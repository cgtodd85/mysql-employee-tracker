## Installation

You will need to run npm init if you do not use my package.json file, install the following dependencies: mysql, inquirer, and optionally dotenv to use your mysql password as an environment variable. Be sure to add your .env file to your .gitignore if uploading to a repo.

## Usage

Run node index in your command line to start and follow the prompts to select your desired actions to updated the database. It is also helpful to use an application like MySQL workbench in conjunction with this.

## Development

The ability to remove an employee is needed for future development, as well as a friendlier or stylized look to the command line prompts.
